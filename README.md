==============

Import from trac to media wiki

WORKING
-------
  * Basic import of wiki pages
  * Revision support (lol, that was easy)
  * Most formatting works, the only thing left is Links (these might be a couple regex, but there will be a lot of special cases to consider
  
TODO
----
  * Add attachment/image support
  * Add some sort of auto-relinking for ticket#, issue#?
